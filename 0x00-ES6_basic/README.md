ES6 Guide
Introduction
ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) is a major update to JavaScript that introduces several powerful features and improvements for better coding practices.

Key Topics
Constants vs Variables: let and var can be reassigned, while const cannot, but properties of const objects can be modified.

Block-Scoped Variables: let and const are block-scoped, providing better variable control compared to var, which is function-scoped.

Arrow Functions: These provide a shorter syntax and automatically bind the this context from their surrounding scope.

Rest and Spread Parameters: Rest (...args) collects all arguments into an array, while spread expands an array into individual elements.

String Templating: Template literals allow embedding variables and expressions directly in strings using backticks (`).

Object Creation: Simplified with shorthand syntax for properties and methods.

Iterators and For-Of Loops: for-of loops provide an easier way to iterate over arrays and other iterable objects.

Conclusion
ES6 introduces many features to make JavaScript more efficient and developer-friendly, streamlining code and improving functionality.
